**Don't panic!**


You have 75 minutes to finish the exam.  
<ul>
<li>You _should_ stay in full screen mode.</li> 
<li>You must hand this midterm in on time.</li>
  <ul><li>Points removed for late submissions.</li></ul>
<li>Absolutely no exams will be accepted after the end of class.</li>
  <ul><li>Only your **first** submission will be accepted.</li>
   <li>Avoid accidental submissions. Fill in your name when you are ready to submit.</li></ul>
</ul>

I recommend that you have a piece of scrap paper to doodle notes
on during the exam.


Consider this midterm **closed book**.   
You can use your notes or other things printed out.
They should be on paper as you may not switch screens after starting the exam.

You **MAY NOT** Google for **answers** or copy from a friend.
You should not receive help from anyone.

You **MUST** use the Google Chrome browser.
