When writing pseudocode or evaluating expressions you may use the following functions:  
 - BigOh, LittleOh, Theta, Omega, LittleOmega which are anonymous functions that represent the respective asymptotic notation  
 - lg, log2, log10 which represent log base \(e\), base 2, and base 10.  When calling asymptotic functions you should use `lg` and the other bases will not create the same resulting value.  
 - T and S which represent the \(T(n)\) and \(S(m)\) recurrence relation functions.  
 - Mathematical functions such as ceiling, floor, abs, max, sqrt, factorial exist.  
 - len returns the length of an array  
 - push(A, e) returns an array A with element e appended to it.  
 - `emptyDictionary()` returns an empty dictionary `{}`.`
 - print will print multiple values  
 - `INFINITY` represents integer infinity  

You are disallowed from using the JavaScript function sort or the array property length.
