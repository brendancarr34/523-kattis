**Don't panic!**


You have 90 minutes to finish the exam.  
<ul>
<li>Except for your zoom session, you *must* stay in full screen mode.</li> 
<li>You must hand this final in on time.</li>
  <ul><li>Points removed for late submissions.</li></ul>
<li>Absolutely no exams will be accepted after the Zoom session.</li>
  <ul><li>Only your **first** submission will be accepted.</li>
   <li>Avoid accidental submissions. Fill in your name when you are ready to submit.</li></ul>
   <li>Ten point penalty if you submit and request another submission.</li></ul>
</ul>

I recommend that you have a least one piece of scrap paper to doodle notes
on during the exam.


Consider this final **closed book**.   
You MAY use your notes or other things printed out.
They MUST be on paper as you may not switch screens after starting the exam.

You **MAY NOT** Google or other external websites for **answers** or copy from a friend.
You **MUST NOT** not receive help from anyone.

You **MUST** use the Google Chrome browser.
